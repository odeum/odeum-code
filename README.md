**ODEUM CodeJS** is an open source Web Application Frontend Framework based upon React.

## CASE: New ODEUM frontend design

```
ODEUM is a cloud-based development platform for designing and developing 
mobile and web applications / services that help professional designers 
and developers to create innovative solutions.
```

* “Our existing Web App frontend is UX deprecated”.
* “We want a new design with better UX, faster and easier to use and understand”.
* “Single-Page-Application (SPA) design”.
* “Reuse of existing ODEUM backend (PHP/MySQL) through Restful API”.
* “Facilitate existing powerful JS view library”.
* “A component based architecture optimized for reuse for all ODEUM Apps (web/mobile)”.
* “Open Source technology with super fast traction and positive appraisal”.

## Enter React

* “ReactJS and React Native looks promising”.
* “Component based model with encapsulation of design and functionality - write once - use everywhere”.
* “Exciting community with tons of eye-balling free stuff”.
* “Possibility to reuse new technical knowledge with React Native for mobile apps”.
* “Top tier company approval (FB, Instagram, Netflix, AirBnB, Microsoft)”.
* “… and probably much more!”.
