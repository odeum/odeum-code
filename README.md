* “Reuse of existing ODEUM backend (PHP/MySQL) through Restful API”.
* “Facilitate existing powerful JS view library”.
* “A component based architecture optimized for reuse for all ODEUM Apps (web/mobile)”.
* “Open Source technology with super fast traction and positive appraisal”.

## Enter React.JS

* “React JS looks promising”.
* “Component based model with encapsulation of design and functionality - write once - use everywhere”.
* “Exciting community with tons of eye-balling free stuff”.
* “Possibility to reuse new technical knowledge with React Native for mobile apps”.
* “Top tier company approval (FB, Instagram, Netflix, AirBnB)”.
* “… and probably much more!”.
