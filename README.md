# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Why ODEUM CodeJS - We needed a new ODEUM frontend design

```
ODEUM is a cloud-based development platform for designing and developing 
mobile and web applications / services that help professional designers 
and developers to create innovative solutions.
```

- “Our existing Web App UX frontend was deprecated and part of a huge monolithic LAMP stack Web Application”
- “We wanted a new design with better UX, faster and easier to use and understand”
- "We wanted to be able to do fast prototyping and develop new Web Apps very fast (RAD)"
- “We wanted a Single-Page-Application (SPA) design with a support friendly system with intelligent routing for deep-linking”
- “We wanted to reuse existing ODEUM backend (PHP/MySQL) through a Restful API”
- “We wanted to facilitate community backed powerful Javascript libraries - no Bootstrap and JQuery”
- “We wanted a component and co-location based architecture optimized for reuse for all ODEUM Apps (web/mobile)”
- “We wanted to use Open Source technology through a super fast evolving community”

## 1.2. Enter ReactJS and React Native

- “ReactJS and React Native looked very promising”
- “Component based model with encapsulation of design and functionality (colocation) - write once - use everywhere”
- “Exciting community with tons of eye-balling free stuff” (and loads of JavaScript fatique to follow)
- “Possibility to reuse technical knowledge with React Native for mobile apps”
- “Top tier company approval (FB, Instagram, Twitter, Netflix, AirBnB, Microsoft and many others)”

# 2. Mission Statement

At WebHouse we set out on a mission in 2016. 

A mission, not just to renew our existing Web UI and UX of our long productline of ODEUM Web and Mobile Apps, 
but a mission to do something amazing. Something new, something exiting, and through that mission give something back 
to a development community we have been a part of since 1995. 

The idea of ODEUM CodeJS originated from the need of a new UI and UX framework for ODEUM Apps. This idea evolved slowly into, not just wanting to produce something that we would be able to use ourselves, but something that others would be able to use and contribute to.

So the idea of open sourcing our work began to evolve. And the ideas just kept flowing in.

- We Love to Code
- We Love Open Source
- We Love Aalborg, the city we live and thrive in
- We gradually began to love ... React

So our mission is to make a state-of-the-art, open source React-based UI framework for building Web & Mobile Applications. 

Made with Love for JavaScript and React, made with passion and help from our friends in Aalborg.

**Made in Aalborg.**

So if you're passionate about ReactJS and JavaScript/NodeJS/CSS, and would like to contribute to the first React-based open source UI/UX framework project in Aalborg please let us know @ <a href="mailto:cb@webhouse.dk" target="_blank">cb@webhouse.dk</a> 

More on how to contribute later ... 

Thanks
