## CASE: New ODEUM frontend design

```
ODEUM is a cloud-based development platform for designing and developing 
mobile and web applications / services that help professional designers 
and developers to create innovative solutions.
```

* “Our existing Web App UX frontend is deprecated and part of a huge monolithic Web Application”
* “We want a new design with better UX, faster and easier to use and understand”
* We want to be able to produce new Web Apps very fast
* “Single-Page-Application (SPA) design”
* “Reuse of existing ODEUM backend (PHP/MySQL) through Restful API”
* “Facilitate existing powerful JS view library”
* “A component based architecture optimized for reuse for all ODEUM Apps (web/mobile)”
* “Open Source technology with super fast traction and positive appraisal”

## Enter React

* “ReactJS and React Native looks promising”
* “Component based model with encapsulation of design and functionality - write once - use everywhere”
* “Exciting community with tons of eye-balling free stuff” (and loads of JavaScript fatique to follow)
* “Possibility to reuse technical knowledge with React Native for mobile apps”
* “Top tier company approval (FB, Instagram, Netflix, AirBnB, Microsoft)”
* “… and probably much more!”
