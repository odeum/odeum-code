# 2. Editor (IDE) and setup (extensions)
We encourage all ODEUM CodeJS developers to use and facilitate Visual Studio Code (VSCode). VSCode is available for both Windows and Mac, so to take advantage of other developers use of an IDE makes a lot of sense when using the same tool.


## 2.1. Our repository
- Find it here: 
- [ODEUM CodeJS Github Repository](https://github.com/odeum/odeum-codejs)

```
Git clone https://github.com/odeum/odeum-codejs
```

## 2.2. Github access and usage (branches)

Initially we pull and commit work to 3 branches:

- development/alpha
- development/beta
- MASTER

## 2.3. Create-React-App (CRA)
All experiments is based upon the Create-React-App (CRA) boilerplate (and zero-configuration) setup from the React team. Using CRA makes it easy to test and check-out other developers experiments and code.

### 2.3.1. Setup instructions

## 2.4. Working with the ODEUM CodeJS framework (evolution)
All initial work is done through experiments. The experiments will facilitate and test different JavaScript libraries and technology and create examples to check-out prosumtions and evaluate the viability of different choices made during our [hackathons](#26-hackathons)

### 2.4.1. Experiments location

- All code experiments must be located in ./experiments/... 
- All experiments should be a full stack CRA implementation which can be installed seperately from within the experiments own folder
- Only reviewed and refactored code (components and scripts) will be accepted and populated to the main ./src folder

## 2.5. Must-read (will update continously)
The following technology areas and articles are all must-reads for newcommers to React and ODEUM CodeJS. 

### 2.5.1. Technology
- React (15.x)
- Redux (3.6.x)
- Redux DevTools Extension (and/or Chrome extension)
- React-Router-Redux (4.x)
- Styled-Components (1.4.x)
- Grid Styled (https://github.com/jxnblk/grid-styled) - http://jxnblk.com/grid-styled/ 

### 2.5.2. Articles
- [Redux.org](http://redux.js.org)
- [Article from Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/redux-for-state-management-in-large-web-apps/)

### 2.5.3. Video tutorials
- [Redux Getting Started](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)

## 2.6. Hackathons
All interns and freelancers are incited to attend our hackathons which is held at WebHouse every second Monday from 17.00 - 21.30. 

During our hackathons we:
- Eat pizza or other healthy meals (Angus beef for the win)
- Drink Coke and coffee
- State of the Union - how far are we with specific experiments and real-world code
- Coding Dojo - learning by doing
- Takeaways and new milestones

## 2.7. Demo Apps 

## 2.8. Real World Apps

### 2.8.1. Filename Refactoring VSCode Extension
A VSCode extension made in NodeJS and follwoing the Microsoft instructions set out here:
